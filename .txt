🚧 Part 2: The "Balance" (What Must Be Done for Production)
To take this to a company/enterprise level, we need to solve 3 major problems:

1. Security Hardening (Critical)
The Problem: Your containers run as root. If a hacker compromises the app, they could take over the entire server node.
The Balance:
 Update Dockerfile to run as a non-root user.
 Add Network Policies (Only allow Flask to talk to Postgres; block everything else).
 Scan images for vulnerabilities (Trivy).



2. Database High Availability (Critical)
The Problem: You have 1 Postgres Pod. If that pod crashes or the node dies, your app stops working (Downtime).
The Balance:
 Implement DB Replication (Primary + Standby) so if one fails, the other takes over instantly.
 Use a Postgres Operator (like CloudNativePG) to manage this automatically.



3. Observability (Important)
The Problem: Right now, you check logs with kubectl logs. If a pod is deleted, the logs are lost forever. You also don't have historical graphs of CPU usage.
The Balance:
 Centralized Logging: Save logs to a system (like Loki/Elasticsearch) so you can debug past crashes.
 Monitoring: Deploy Prometheus & Grafana to see nice dashboards of your traffic/errors.
